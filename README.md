# SQL for ERP Data Analysis & Validation

## Project Overview
This repository contains SQL scripts designed to simulate **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)** data management tasks. As a Business Systems Analyst, I utilized SQL to ensure **data integrity** and drive **business insights**.

## Key Features
- **Data Integrity Checks:** Identifies "orphaned" orders that lack valid customer links.
- **Performance Reporting:** Aggregates monthly sales data to track revenue trends.
- **Process Optimization:** Detects shipment delays (>7 days) to improve operational efficiency.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **JOINs & Aggregations:** Using `LEFT JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, and `SUM`.
- **Business Logic:** Translating operational requirements into technical queries.

*Note: These scripts are for demonstration purposes based on standard SQL syntax.*
